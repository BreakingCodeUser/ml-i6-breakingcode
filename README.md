# Tracking Costs with Tagging

 

Our budget is ***$500***.

 

I spoke with @Nate Baechtold regarding how to track costs for SageMaker and he said we can track the costs in Cloudability if we tag everything we use in AWS correctly. Since we’ll be using the UI, we’ll have to remember to manually tag things. So I propose tagging as follows:

 

| Tag Key        | Tag Value                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| EisApplication | innovation-iteration-14-6-breaking-code |
| EisArt | Cia |
| EisDomain | platform |
| EisMarket | shared |
| EisTeam | breaking-code |
    
Track costs in Cloudability based on tags.
